Riot on the radio
Pictures on the TV
Invader man take what he can
Shootout on the silver screen
Sticking them up and knocking them down
Living out a fantasy
There is a bad man cruising around
In a big black limousine
Do not let it be wrong
Do not let it be right
Get in his way
You are dead in his sights
Big gun
Big gun number one
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you
Terminators Uzi makers
Shooting up Hollywood
Snakes alive with a
Setting off and doing no good
If you ain't wise they will cannibalize
Tear flesh off you
Classified lady killers
Praying in the human zoo Praying
They saddle you up
And take you to town
Better look out
When he come around
Big gun
Big gun
