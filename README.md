Song Parser
It was created on Python3, and needs Python3 to run.
It reads the song (or any text) from stdin, prints out the song nicely, gets unique words used in it and prints them out.
To run the programm feed your text to song_parser.py
There are an example script "run" and example song "test_song" which demonstrate how the programm works. To try it out, simply execute the "run" file (needs Bash to run).
